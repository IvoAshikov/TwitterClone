# Twitter Clone

This Twitter Clone was made with React and makes use of the Twitter API to access its features and functionality. The goal of this project was to replicate the functionality and user interface of the popular platform as closely as possible. By utilizing the Twitter API, I implemented the search for users function, the current trends in USA, the current profile pictures and usernames of different users, etc.
